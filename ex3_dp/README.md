# Exercise 3: Dynamic Programming

## Setup

* Python 3.5+ (for type hints)

Install requirements with the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Complete the code

### Code structure

- Both the gridworld and car rental environments are defined in `env.py`. 
- As the car rental problem is fairly complex, we have tried to give you as many hints as possible for the environment implementations. 
- In turn, no starter code is provided for any of the algorithms or visualizations. You may wish to create a file `algorithms.py` and put all algorithms as functions here. Create a `main.py` as well to run your code.
- In your algorithms, you may be able to use the same policy iteration function for both environments. The environments have a `expected_return()` function that may be useful.

Fill in the sections marked with `TODO`. The docstrings for each function should help you get started. The starter code is designed to only guide you and you are free to use it as-is or modify it however you like.
