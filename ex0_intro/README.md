# Exercise 0: An Invitation to Reinforcement Learning

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Complete the code

There is only one file `ex0.py`. Fill in the sections marked with `TODO`. The docstrings for each function should help you get started. The starter code is designed to only guide you and you are free to use it as-is or modify it however you like.
- Q1: `simulate()`
- Q2: `manual_policy()`, `agent()`
- Q3: `random_policy()`
- Q4: `worse_policy()`, `better_policy()`
For Q3 and Q4, you need to implement your own plotting code.

## Run the code

```bash
python ex0.py
```
